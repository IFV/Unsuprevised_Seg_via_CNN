## Evaluation and Results:
We evaluated four settings of the proposed algorithm on the task of bone segmentation in bone SPECT images:

* Mode 1: Unsupervised (self-supervised) training with L_ACWE.

* Mode 2: Mode 1 + fine-tuning using L_label with 10 ground truth (GT) labels.

* Mode 3: Mode 1 + fine-tuning using L_label with 80 GT labels.

* Mode 4: Training with L_ACWE + L_label.

The quantitative results can be found in the paper, and here are some qualitative results:
